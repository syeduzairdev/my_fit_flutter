A Flutter application that works as a companion app for bluetooth watches.
Connect a bluetooth watch and see the data on your phone.

As of now, it supports the following data:

1. Heart Rate
2. Battery level
3. Steps
4. Sleep

[Note: This app is under development and may contain bugs.]

[Refer to DocumentationToReadData.md to know, how is the data being extracted.]

Any help would be welcomed.
